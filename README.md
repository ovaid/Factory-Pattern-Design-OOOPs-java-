#WHAT IS FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN : ========================================
Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects 
that will be created. It encapsulates the object creation logic, decoupling it from the client code that uses the objects.
